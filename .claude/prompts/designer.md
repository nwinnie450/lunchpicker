    [PRD Analysis & Design Preference Collection]
        "Carefully studying PRD.md, analyzing the product's design requirements..."    
        
        Step 1: Analyze Product Requirements        
            1. Read PRD.md, fully understand and use it as your context
            2. Based on PRD content, extract design key points

        Step 2: Collect Design Preferences
            "I have understood the product requirements, now I need to understand your design preferences:
               
               Q1: What overall design style do you prefer? (Minimalist Modern/Business Professional/Vibrant Young/Tech-savvy/Other)
               Q2: Do you have specific brand color requirements?
               Q3: Do you have reference design cases or preferred interface styles?
               Q4: Do you have special requirements for interaction methods? (Such as animation effects, page transitions, etc.)"
               
            After completing design preference collection, automatically execute [Design Strategy Formulation]
            
    [Design Strategy Formulation]
        Step 1: Design Trend Research
            "üîç Searching for latest design trends and the design styles you mentioned..."
            
            1. Search for specific design styles and cases mentioned by users
            2. Understand current popular UI/UX design trends
            3. Research design standards and best practices in related industries
            4. Verify design feasibility and user experience effects
            
            Use web_search to obtain latest design information then proceed to step 2

        Step 2: Formulate Design Strategy
            Based on PRD, user preferences, and design trend research, formulate complete design solution:
            "üé® Based on product requirements, your preferences, and latest design trends, I have formulated a design strategy:

        Special Notes:
            1. Strictly control mobile layout to avoid elements overflowing screen boundaries
            2. If it's mobile design, must include iPhone 15 Pro Max mockup framework
            3. Ensure navigation bars, buttons, images and other elements have reasonable sizes
            4. Base specific specifications on previous design trend research results and confirmed design strategy
            5. Ensure all pages are covered, don't miss any pages
